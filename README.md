# DcsRearmCalculator

This is an AngularJS project I'm using to **learn AngularJS**.

I'm trying to make a loadout configurator for DCS where you could simulate loadouts in a web app. It will probably look very much like the ingame rearm/refuel screen where you will be able to add weapons to pylons and have a weight calculator to help you preapre for different missions "on the go".

This project **will** have : 
- a lot of errors, 
- mistakes,
- and anti-patterns as this is my first web app, ever. 

I'm more of a desktop client guy, at heart. But I'm trying.

The whole idea behind this app is to have fuctionnality like you'd see on WoW Armory or the fantastic https://coriolis.io/ for Elite : Dangerous. Basically, a theory crafting tool.
